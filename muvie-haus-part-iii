# Movie Haus 3.0

Gerard von Schtieffel just came back from a month long trip to San
Fran, where he was looking for investors for his new Netflix-like
venture. He happened to drunkenly stumble into the ReactConf and is
now demanding his movie-haus app to be a fully blown React SPA. 

Incorporate a single theater first, and only go onto multiple theaters
after everything is working perfectly for a single theater. 

Treat this as a fully blow project (which it is). Design your
application layout learning from your mistakes in Movie Haus 2.0. Draw
wireframes! 

You should be able to use your backend from Movie Haus 2.0 if you
wrote it correctly. f you didn't this is a great time to build another API.

When you have a clear picture of how your application will function
focus on breaking everything into React components. Make sure you hold
state in the correct components. Do not over-engineer. 

When you components are worked out create your react directory
structure, with dummy files to hold your components. Build it
modularly from the start. 

Congratulations! You are now full stack developers working with the
hottest of technologies!
